## About me

I am a former math teacher, who is eager to transfer my skills to the world of data analytics and data science. I have continued my education through various programs and self-study to hone my coding skills.

My strong skills developed from my experience as a teacher, of analysis for data-driven instruction and presenting mathematical concepts and models to technical and non-technical audiences will make me an asset to your team.

## Below are links to some projects I put together during my self study time exploring data analysis and data science.
